# Customer Management Page - Comprehensive Rewrite Summary

## Overview
The customers.tsx page has been completely rewritten from scratch to provide a robust, interactive, and demo-ready customer management interface. This rewrite addresses all the critical issues identified in the original implementation and implements modern React patterns with enhanced user experience.

## Key Improvements Made
